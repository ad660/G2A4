# Welcome to our repository

In our repositiory we will have the following for your convenience:

1. This readme file will have 6 different markdown text formatting features
2. We will demonstrate a scenario of how to work as a team on github
   - (git add, commit, pull and merge)
   - We will use meaningful commit messages
   - We will use appropriate branches to synchronise workflow
   - Adding files to branches
3. Create a gitignore file
4. Create a requirements.txt file and briefly explain what it's for

## **How to work as a team on github**

### 1. Set up a branch using **git checkout -b < branch-name >** (without the spaces next to the branch name)

![screenshot of checking out a branch](/workflowImages/git%20branch.png)

### 2. Complete your changes and then use **git add . or git add -A**

![this is the difference between what your files should look like before git adding](/workflowImages/git%20before%20add.png)
![Git after add](/workflowImages/git%20after%20add.png)

### 3. Now **commit your changes**, if its the first time you may have to set the upstream origin to your local repo name

### 4. Now **git push**

![git push](/workflowImages/git%20push%20origin%20.png)

### 5. First **select the branch** you want to create a pull request from:

### 6. Select **'new pull request'**

### 7. Now **create your pull request** and check that everything looks in order

![create pull request p1.1](/workflowImages/Create%20request.png)
![pt 2](/workflowImages/Create%20request%202.png)

### 8. Finally **merge**

# What is a Gitignore ?

A gitignore (.gitignore) is a file that is usually used in GIT to specify files and folder (Directories) that are to be ignored and therefore not tracked by version control. In other words a Gitignore file is utilised to exclude files that were created during the initial development stages. Some examples of such files are:

\*Compiled codes, logs as well as temporary files. Any files that are added to the gitignore files are not considered for staging nor to be committed into a repository. The benefit of a gitignore is that assists in keeping a repository clean and further reduces cluttering.

# What is a Git requirement?

A git requirement is essentially the requirement one needs to have on their computer or laptop which then allows them to use Git.
Those git requirements are:

- To download and install GitHub onto your computer or Laptop (via the official website)
- Use compatible operating systems such as MAC, Linux and Windows
- The user of Git should also have a good comprehension of command lines interface and how to implement the command
  in their terminal or, at least how to search the internet for the correct command lines to then use in their terminal
- The user will also need to have a repository hosting system such as GitHub or GitLab
